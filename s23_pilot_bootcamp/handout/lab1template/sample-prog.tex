\section*{Completing a Programming Assignment}

In this section, we'll walk through the steps of downloading,
completing, and submitting a programming assignment. You'll do this
for each assignment, so come back here if you get confused.

You will be primarily using the command \lstinline'autolab122' to
interact with \autolab{}.  You can also use the \autolab{} web site
(\href{\autolabURL}{\autolabURL}) if you prefer.


\begin{part}\TAGS{unix}
To begin with, you need to do a one-time setup for \lstinline'autolab122'.
Simply run
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% autolab122 setup
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
and follow the instructions.  You will not need to do this again.
Here's a sample interaction.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{\img/autolab122-setup.png}
\end{center}
\end{part}


\begin{part}\TAGS{unix}
  Make sure you are in the \lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'private/15122'
  directory by entering the command
  \underline{\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'pwd'} to get the
    \textbf{\color{red}p}resent
  \textbf{\color{red}w}orking \textbf{\color{red}d}irectory. You should see something like this with your andrew id
  instead of \lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'<your_id>':

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% pwd
/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/<usr_number>/<your_id>/private/15122
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
If you ever get lost, you can go there by entering
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% cd
% cd private/15122
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
\end{part}


\begin{part}\TAGS{unix}
  You can list the currently released assignments by running
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% autolab122 hw
  sample (Sample Assignment (UNGRADED))
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
You will see the assignment called \lstinline'sample' --- the
description in parentheses is for your information only --- and
possibly other material we are distributing through \autolab{}.  You
will be using this name (\lstinline'sample') when interacting with
Autolab about this assignment.
\end{part}


\begin{part}\TAGS{unix}
  Download the starter code for assignment \lstinline'sample' with
  the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% autolab122 download sample
Querying assessment 'sample' of course '15122-[*\shortsem*]' ...
Creating directory /home/iliano/TMP/sample
Handout downloaded into assessment directory
Writeup downloaded into assessment directory

Due: Mon Jun 29 18:00:00 2020
sample successfully downloaded.
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
This creates a directory called \lstinline'sample' with the following
contents:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% ls sample
factorial.c0  favorite_number.c0  README.txt
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
The file \lstinline'README.txt' tells you how to compile the
assignment and how to submit it.  The other files are what you'll be
working on.
\end{part}

\subsection*{Submitting Programming Assignments}

\begin{part}
You will submit the assignment by typing the following
at the Unix prompt:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% autolab122 handin sample factorial.c0 favorite_number.c0
\end{lstlisting}\vspace{-1.5ex}
The command to type is always written at the bottom of the file
\lstinline'README.txt' that comes with each assignment.

This command will ask you to acknowledge the academic integrity policy
of the class and then submit the files to \autolab{}.  Once \autolab{}
is done grading this submission, it will display your scores.  Here's
the full output:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}, deletekeywords={for},
  deletedelim={[l]{Type\ }}, deletestring={[b]{'}}]
% autolab122 handin sample factorial.c0 favorite_number.c0
Type "yes" to affirm that you have complied with this course's
academic integrity policy as defined in the syllabus: yes
Submitting to 15122-[*\shortsem*]:sample ... (force)
Successfully submitted to Autolab (version 1)

Waiting for scores to be ready ...
Scores for 15122-[*\shortsem*]:sample
 version | handin (1.0) | editing (1.0) |
+---------+--------------+---------------+
|       1 |          1.0 |           0.0 |
\end{lstlisting}

At this point, you can see the overall \autolab{} feedback with
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% autolab122 feedback
\end{lstlisting}
\chkptB
\end{part}
